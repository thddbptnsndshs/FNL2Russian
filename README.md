# L2 Russian of Forest Nenets speakers

This is a repository for the L2 Russian of Forest Nenets speakers (FNL2Russian) project. I study the neutralization contrast in FNL2Russian. Forest Nenets (FN) lacks any laryngeal contrast, whereas Russian stops and fricatives do exhibit a voicing contrast in non-final positions. This discrepancy manifests itself in how native FN speakers speak Russian, which I aim to demonstrate with acoustic data.

Repo structure:
- `youngconf_slides/` -- LaTeX project of my slides for the 20th Conference on Typology and Grammar for Young Scholars (in Russian)
- `data_processing.ipynb` -- notebook for data preprocessing and statistical testing of hypotheses
